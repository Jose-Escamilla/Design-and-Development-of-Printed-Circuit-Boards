High precision 0603(1608) series chip resistor 3D model.
All items in one SolidWorks 2020 file (resistant value property editable method).
Parasolid files for Altium Designer 3D body placement
and Keyshot9 package files for rendering are provided.

First Upload::
:18-10-2020 Upload 0 ohm, 56 ohm, 100 ohm, 220 ohm, 270 ohm,
            330 ohm, 560 ohm, 1K, 2.2K, 10K, 20K.

:18-10-2020 Model name change and re-generate file.
            Replace xxx.x_b to xxx.x_t
            (for Altium Designer 3D device body placement).
            Adding 15 ohm, 20 ohm, 22 ohm, 27 ohm, 33 ohm,
            47 ohm, 68 ohm, 75 ohm, 82 ohm 96 ohm, 110 ohm.

Last Update::
:19-10-2020 Changing from extruded-cut of text to extruded-boss by 0.005 mm.
            Re-generate files.
            Adding 2 ohm, 6.8 ohm, 8.2 ohm, 13 ohm, 18 ohm.

:20-10-2020 Replace method of resistant selection
            from
            resistant-value model configuration selection -->> model propertries value editing.
            Removed of all configuratings.

            Resistant value assign by "Resistant Value" of model property.
            :::: File -> Properties -> Configuration Specific Tab
            :::: in "Resistant Value" row, enter the specific value (resistant-code) in "Value/Text Expression".
            :::: then click "OK", and rebuild the model by press "Ctrl+B" or goto Edit -> Rebuild.

:21-10-2020 Resistant code revised.
:28-10-2020 Electrical pin and coating thickness changed.
            Marking of resistant code font-type changed.
            Color changed.
            Some cut-out and extrude changed.            

Note:: No more of resistant value configuration adding due value changing use property method instead,
       But more items of parasolid files will be adding as we had generated.
