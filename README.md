# Design-and-Development-of-Printed-Circuit-Boards
Course taught by IECA where throughout this module a small PCB will be designed in order to familiarize the student with the Altium Designer software. The corresponding manufacturing documents will be generated.

## **General Course Objective**:
The student will gain the basic concepts of the design process of an electronic printed circuit board (PCB), as well as learning for the selection of basic electronic components, elementary design considerations and the development of multiple problem solving skills in the development of an electronic product (PCB).

### **Competencies to be Developed**:
Throughout this module a small PCB will be designed in order for the student to become familiar with Altium Designer software. The corresponding manufacturing documents will be generated.
At the end of the module the student will be able to:
- Properly document a project.
- Design a simple PCB with the PCB software.
- Generate the necessary documentation to manufacture an assembly.
- Generate the necessary documentation to assemble a board.
